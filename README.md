BspZipGui
=========

BspZipGui is GUI tool for Valve's BSPZIP command line utility. It is used to easily **embed** a folder with all your custom files(textures, models, scripts etc) into a BSP file. With BspZipGui you can also **extract** all files contained inside BSP file. The main feature of BspZipGui is that it automatically generates a file list from the folder you specified and then runs bspzip.exe to embed these files into BSP. The application can be used for any Source game including Nuclear Dawn, Left 4 Dead 2 and Counter Strike Global Offensive.
